# Future backend boundary

The first release is a static client-side catalogue. A future service may expose `GET /api/catalog`, `/api/catalog/:id`, `/api/catalog/summary`, `/api/catalog/domains`, and `/api/catalog/categories`. The public contract should remain compatible with `data/prototype-catalog.json`. CRC-MDT is a separate authenticated clinical workspace and is not a runtime data source for this public site.
