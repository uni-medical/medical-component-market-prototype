# Medical Component Market Homepage

Public homepage and marketplace directory for medical AI research components. The first release is a static Vite + React site with client-side search and filters, using public-safe catalogue metadata.

## Routes

- `/` — homepage
- `/marketplace` — marketplace directory

## Local development

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The site does not connect to CRC-MDT or request GitHub at runtime. Future backend boundaries are documented in `docs/backend-integration.md`.
